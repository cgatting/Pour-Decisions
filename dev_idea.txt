# PROJECT SCOPE: POUR DECISIONS
### The Neon Noir Idle Bartender Simulation

**Version:** 2.0 (The "Snazzy Update" Baseline)
**Document Date:** October 26, 2023

---

## 1. Executive Overview

**"Pour Decisions"** is an atmospheric idle/incremental game with life simulation elements, focusing on the grueling reality of climbing the career ladder in the nightlife industry.

The player starts as a humble Glass Collector and must grind shifts, manage vital stats (Energy and Stress), navigate a treacherous commute, and cope with the crushing pressure of weekly rent, all while trying to save enough cash and gain enough experience to buy better gear and secure promotions.

The aesthetic is "Neon Noir"—dark, gritty, accented by bright neon lights, characterized by a sleek, glassmorphism-based user interface.

## 2. Current Phase Specifications (v2.0 Baseline)

The current build features a complete, playable core loop with high-fidelity UI.

### 2.1 Core Gameplay Loop
1.  **The Home Phase:** Player rests at home to recover Energy and reduce Stress. Rent pressure ticks up constantly.
2.  **The Commute:** Player chooses transport (Bus vs. Car) to travel to the bar. Risks include lateness (wage penalty) or car breakdowns (stress/cost).
3.  **The Grind:** Player initiates a shift at the bar.
    * *Costs:* Immediate deduction of Energy and increase in Stress.
    * *Rewards:* Cash (Wage + randomized Tips) and XP upon completion.
    * *Variables:* Random "Shift Events" occur (40% chance) modifying rewards/costs. Lateness removes tips.
4.  **Progression:** Cash is spent on survival (Rent/Repairs) or upgrades (Shop). XP is used to unlock higher-tier jobs on the Career Ladder.

### 2.2 Key Mechanics Implemented
* **Vitals System:**
    * **Energy:** Fuel for working. Depleted by shifts/events. Recovered by sleeping.
    * **Stress:** The burnout meter. Increased by working and negative events. High stress (>90%) prevents working. Recovered by sleeping or specific items.
* **Economy of Pressure (Rent):**
    * A constantly filling "Rent Cycle" bar. Hitting 100% triggers a payment demand.
    * Failure to pay results in "Eviction" (Cash reset to 0, job demotion back to Glass Collector).
    * *Lifestyle Creep:* Higher job titles significantly increase base rent.
* **Career Ladder:**
    * 6 Jobs (Glass Collector to Bar Owner).
    * Gated by XP requirements and some cash entry fees (e.g., Mixology Course).
* **Dynamic Commute:**
    * **Bus:** Free, slow, high chance of lateness penalty.
    * **Car:** Buyable item. Fast. Chance of stressful traffic or expensive breakdowns requiring repairs.
* **The Shop (Dark Web Store):**
    * Functional upgrades that alter gameplay math (e.g., Shoes reduce energy cost, Headphones reduce stress gain, Bed improves sleep recovery).

### 2.3 Technical Stack & UI Aesthetic
* **Framework:** React.js (Vite bundler recommended).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
* **Icons:** Lucide React.
* **Design Language:** "Neon Noir Glassmorphism."
    * Dark mode heavily utilizing gradients (indigo/purple/amber).
    * UI elements use `backdrop-blur`, semi-transparent backgrounds, and subtle light borders.
    * Tactile buttons with significant hover/active states and glows.

## 3. Future Roadmap & Expansion Ideas

This section outlines potential features for future updates, categorized by complexity and impact.

### Phase 3.0: Immediate Polish & Persistence (Short-Term)

* **Local Storage Persistence:** The game currently resets on refresh. State (cash, xp, jobs, upgrades, day count) must be saved to `localStorage` regularly and loaded on initialize.
* **Event Pool Expansion:** Increase `SHIFT_EVENTS` from 20 to 50+ to reduce repetition. Add rarer, higher-impact events.
* **Better Tooltips:** Hovering over Energy/Stress bars should show current regen/drain rates based on owned items.
* **Settings Menu:** Toggle for sound (if added), reset game data button, and perhaps a "Low Performance mode" (disabling blurs) for older devices.

### Phase 3.1: Deepening the Mechanics (Mid-Term)

* **The "Active Grind" Minigame:**
    * Currently, working is a single button press.
    * *Idea:* Add an optional "Active Reload" mechanic. When clicking "Start Shift," a quick-time event appears (e.g., stopping a slider in a green zone). Hitting it perfectly grants a "Perfect Pour" bonus (+10% tips, -5% stress). Missing it causes a "Spillage" penalty.
* **Consumable Items:**
    * The shop only has permanent upgrades.
    * *Idea:* Add consumable items for mid-shift emergencies. Energy Drinks (instant energy, slight stress increase), Cigarettes/Vape (instant stress decrease, slight health/energy hit).
* **Apartment Upgrades:**
    * Home is static.
    * *Idea:* Allow buying apartment upgrades distinct from gear. A better gaming setup reduces stress faster. A better kitchen reduces food costs (if food is implemented).

### Phase 3.2: The "Bar Owner" Endgame (Long-Term)

* **Bar Tycoon Mode:**
    * Currently, reaching "Bar Owner" is just a high-paying job.
    * *Idea:* Upon becoming Owner, the gameplay loop changes. You no longer click "Work Shift." Instead, you manage the bar.
    * You hire NPCs to fill the roles you used to do.
    * You set menu prices (balancing profit vs. customer satisfaction).
    * Your income becomes passive, based on the bar's popularity and staff efficiency. Stress comes from managing crises (staff calling in sick, health inspections) rather than physical labor.

### Phase 4.0: "Moonshot" Ideas (Major Expansions)

* **Narrative Threads & NPCs:**
    * Introduce recurring characters (a demanding regular, a rival bartender, a shady promoter).
    * Short narrative arcs that trigger based on career milestones, offering unique rewards or heavy penalties.
* **Multiple Locations:**
    * Start in a dive bar. Eventually, move to a high-end club in the city center (higher rent, higher stress, massive earning potential).
* **Social Stats / Reputation:**
    * A "Reputation" meter. High reputation attracts better clientele (better tips) but raises expectations (higher stress if you mess up). Low reputation attracts trouble.

## 4. Design Pillars (To guide future development)

Any new feature added to "Pour Decisions" must adhere to these pillars:

1.  **The Grind Must Feel Real:** Progress should feel earned. The pressure of rent and the exhaustion of energy shouldn't be trivialized. The game should feel slightly unfair at times, just like the real service industry.
2.  **Style Over Substance (Almost):** The UI must remain sleek, glowing, and tactile. Even boring stat screens should look like a cyberpunk HUD.
3.  **Decisions Matter:** Every choice (taking the bus vs. driving, buying shoes vs. saving for rent, taking a double shift vs. sleeping) should have a tangible trade-off in resources or risk.
